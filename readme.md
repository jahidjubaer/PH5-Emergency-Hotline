### 1.Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll : 
getElementById : Selects only one specific element by its id.
getElementsByClassName : Selects all elements that have the given class.
querySelector: Selects the first element that matches the CSS selector.
querySelectorAll: Selects all elements that match the selector. 

### 2. Create and insert a new element into the DOM
```js
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
document.getElementById("history-container").appendChild(newDiv) 
```

### 3.Event Bubbling and how does it work
When you click or trigger an event on a child element, JS will first run the event for that element, then go up step by step to its parent, then the parentâ€™s parent, and so on until it reaches the top.

Events bubble up from child -> parent -> grandparent -> document -> window.

### 4.Event Delegation in JavaScript and Why is it useful
You attach a single event listener on a parent element, and use event bubbling to handle events on its child elements.
#### Why useful?
Improves performance
Works for dynamically added elements

### 5.difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods
preventDefault() : Stops the default action  of an element . like submit
stopPropagation() : Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements
